# Detect Potato disease by using TensorFlow

## A simple example using Tensorflow and CNN to classify images

This project is an exercise after learning Tensorflow and CNN. Every part of this project is following these steps:
* Classify images into batchs
* Train test split
* Make layers
* Make model's layers
* Make optimizer and loss function
* Model.fit
* Export the images with actual and predicted title
